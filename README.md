### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Abhishek**], a develooper based in india.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, and framer motion. My favorite tools are gemini, notion, and procreate on my window.

I’ve built over 100 public repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than 200 at this point.

#### Fun Facts:

* I don’t like coffee or tea
* Demon Slayer is my favorite anime
* **Hobbies:** anime, gym, building things
